* Setting up the Database

Over the course of this week I worked on multiple areas within the project with Jake, we were able to succesfully create all of our endpoint pertaining to songs. We currently have the GET & DELETE songs fully functional with the ability for data to be stored in the database. We connected the endpoints to the main.py file to be able to show up on localhost8000 for testing.Even though we finished writing the code for all of our song endpoints we still need to fix the functionality that connects to the user database. As a team, we decided to use HTML5 to show the songs at first until we are able to meet our strech goal of uploading a song.It was interesting to figure out how everything connects using postgreSQL, pydantic, and FastAPI, but I feel a lot more confident writing & understanding the code that I wrote after working with it throughout the week.
