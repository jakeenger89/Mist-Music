* Database Functionality

This week I have been working on completing funcationality for backend API's for Songs & User authenticaton, POST for User, GET for a specific song in our database, and I was trying to play around with the frontend code. All API's that I have made are functional and I was able to create a lot of them by linking them to our database models and adding protection. As a team we talked briefly about how we're going to implement our search bar that is going to be on almost every page. I learned a lot when it comes to setting up the backend authorization this week.

* Setting up the Database

Over the course of this week I worked on multiple areas within the project with Jake, we were able to succesfully create all of our endpoint pertaining to songs. We currently have the GET & DELETE songs fully functional with the ability for data to be stored in the database. We connected the endpoints to the main.py file to be able to show up on localhost8000 for testing.Even though we finished writing the code for all of our song endpoints we still need to fix the functionality that connects to the user database. As a team, we decided to use HTML5 to show the songs at first until we are able to meet our strech goal of uploading a song.It was interesting to figure out how everything connects using postgreSQL, pydantic, and FastAPI, but I feel a lot more confident writing & understanding the code that I wrote after working with it throughout the week.
