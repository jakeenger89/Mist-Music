Today, I worked on the backend endpoints for the merchandise section of Mist Music. Specifically GET and POST.

Earlier in the week, the rest of the team and I set up all the "create tables" for the project. This includes: Users, Merchandise, Songs, and Albums.

After getting feedback, we decided to forego Spotify and Soundcloud APIs in favor of a html audio player. This will make things a bit more smooth if we get to our stretch goal of allowing users to upload songs on our site.

I did not understand how to setup the backend on FastAPI at the start of this, but as we work on them, it's starting to make sense.
