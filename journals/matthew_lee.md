Today we all worked on CSS, making our site look much better,

We had to decide on what to use to design our site. We ended up using vanilla CSS and bootstrap since we couldn't get Tailwind working in time. Although, I managed to set it up, but we're too far into the vanilla CSS now.

I've been trying to implement Stripe API into the project and I'm learning a lot about API's in general.

Today and all last week, I worked on the merchandise frontend.

There were features we didn't account for when planning out the merchandise. We needed to be able to add multiple sizes (like sizes of t-shirts) of one item of varying quantities to the item detail. It's difficult to account for everything at the start of a project.

Working with frontend this past week definitely improved my understanding of it.

Today I worked on the frontend portion of merchandise.

Earlier in the week, I finished up all of the endpoints for merchandise. This includes, GET all, GET one, DELETE, POST, and PUT.
I also started on Customer endpoints.

We overlooked the endpoints required to get the search bar for our app to work, so we had to decide on how to handle that. I imagine this will happen a few more times during this project. It's difficult to think of absolutely everything we would need to get things running in the beginning.

I've been learning a lot of useful tools in VSCode, specifically the replace all feature. It helped a lot when we had to change the name of one of our objects.

Today, I worked on the backend endpoints for the merchandise section of Mist Music. Specifically GET and POST.

Earlier in the week, the rest of the team and I set up all the "create tables" for the project. This includes: Users, Merchandise, Songs, and Albums.

After getting feedback, we decided to forego Spotify and Soundcloud APIs in favor of a html audio player. This will make things a bit more smooth if we get to our stretch goal of allowing users to upload songs on our site.

I did not understand how to setup the backend on FastAPI at the start of this, but as we work on them, it's starting to make sense.
