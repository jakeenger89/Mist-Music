    some features i worked on this week with Brandon includes the routers and quieries files related to songs. so the two songs.py files. we worked on Get song and Post song and were able to have it display on FastAPI at localhost:8000/doc. Additionally I added the liking a song and unliking a song as well and shows up in FastAPI. though we are still planning to go through bugs pertaining to the information not showing up on the GET and POST requests. One AH HA moment i had this week was as simple as changing variable names to match names from the models to the routers. the overall ah ha really was understanding how the two communicate and what it does, its nice to get to be able to play with code and see it working,helps learn alot.
