    some features i worked on this week with Brandon includes the routers and quieries files related to songs. so the two songs.py files. we worked on Get song and Post song and were able to have it display on FastAPI at localhost:8000/doc. Additionally I added the liking a song and unliking a song as well and shows up in FastAPI. though we are still planning to go through bugs pertaining to the information not showing up on the GET and POST requests.
