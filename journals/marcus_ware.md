Today, I worked on the backend endpoints for the merchandise section of Mist Music. Specifically GET requests for all users and for a specific user. I worked with Noah on the User endpoints and we plan on tackling the Album section of the endpoints next week.
My group also created a few tables such as merchandise, users, songs, and albums. I am currently going through a small blocker regarding the get user and get all user endpoints, but I am making some progress after talking to my group and fixing small errors and such.
I also was struggling with the fastAPI concepts but it is starting to make more sense to me now.
