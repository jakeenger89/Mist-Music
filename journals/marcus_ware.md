Today, I worked on the backend endpoints for the user section of Mist Music. Specifically GET requests for all users and for a specific user. I worked with Noah on the User endpoints and we plan on tackling the Album section of the endpoints next week.
My group also created a few tables such as merchandise, users, songs, and albums. I am currently going through a small blocker regarding the get user and get all user endpoints, but I am making some progress after talking to my group and fixing small errors and such.
I also was struggling with the fastAPI concepts but it is starting to make more sense to me now.

This week I was working on fixing up the endpoints for Get All Users and Getting a specific user. We were able to fix up the get all users get request and since then, we've been focusing on creating the front end of our website. So far we have created the login form, sign up form for users and we've also created a form to allow users to "upload" a song. I personally consider frontend work my weakest skill so being able to practice with this project has been a good experience for me so far.

During this week, I went through setting up the CI and CD delopyment for our project. I had a few blockers but I was able to get help through Rosheen's office hour. The Login form on the front end is also complete as well as a user, someone can click the sign up form button and it will create their account. I was also able to make a about us page that is barebones and I was able to proplerly link it to the navbar as well. I will have to add profile pictures of each of us to that page and some other details like our own linkIn pages to finish off that page. Next, I will be working on a few more front end pages like the home page and the account details page. Frontend is still my weakest skill as a programmer so I am looking forward to being able to practice with these pages.

During this last week, I went through setting up several search endpoints. I was able to implement a search endpoint that allows us to search accounts by username, songs by song name, and album by album name. From there, I was able to implement several search pages and search results pages that utilizes the search endpoints that I've created. Now if a user (or non user) goes to our website to search an account, song, or albumb, they can search and it will return the expected results that also link you to the right area of our website. This week was quite challenging as I've never implemented a search endpoint before and because I am not that great in using react yet. So this week was overall great time for me to learn and practice.
