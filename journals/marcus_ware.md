Today, I worked on the backend endpoints for the user section of Mist Music. Specifically GET requests for all users and for a specific user. I worked with Noah on the User endpoints and we plan on tackling the Album section of the endpoints next week.
My group also created a few tables such as merchandise, users, songs, and albums. I am currently going through a small blocker regarding the get user and get all user endpoints, but I am making some progress after talking to my group and fixing small errors and such.
I also was struggling with the fastAPI concepts but it is starting to make more sense to me now.

This week I was working on fixing up the endpoints for Get All Users and Getting a specific user. We were able to fix up the get all users get request and since then, we've been focusing on creating the front end of our website. So far we have created the login form, sign up form for users and we've also created a form to allow users to "upload" a song. I personally consider frontend work my weakest skill so being able to practice with this project has been a good experience for me so far.
