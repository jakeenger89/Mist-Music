Next work to be done is with the albums endpoints.

## November 21-28

this week was spent on multiple diffrent backend portions. setting up the user and album backed funtions and routes.
there were some blockers along the way when it came to authentication of some user profile features and album protected endpoints. the last part of the week was spent on starting the front end creating a main page and multiple forms that we will need for the site. we also began trying to make sure all the routes work on the front end.
